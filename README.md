## üìù Project Description

**VidyoDaya** is a fully functional ed-tech platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). It allows users to create, consume, and rate educational content. 

### Key Features:
- A seamless, interactive learning experience for students.
- A platform for instructors to showcase their expertise.
- Built to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

## üìå Technology Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structures the content with tags and elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage, improving accessibility and readability.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the website.
- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A runtime that allows server-side scripting using JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist framework for building robust web applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

---

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The platform follows a client-server architecture, with three main components:
- **Front-end**: Built using ReactJS and communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
- **Back-end**: Built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs and handling business logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store course content, user data, and other information.

## üîå API Design

VidyoDaya uses RESTful API endpoints, built with Node.js and Express.js, to handle communication between the front-end and back-end.

### Sample API Endpoints:
- **POST** `/api/auth/signup`: Create a new user account.
- **POST** `/api/auth/login`: Log in and generate a JWT token.
- **GET** `/api/courses`: Get a list of available courses.
- **POST** `/api/courses`: Create a new course.
- **POST** `/api/courses/:id/rate`: Add a rating to a course.
